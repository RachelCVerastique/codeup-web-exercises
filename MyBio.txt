My name is Rachel and I am old. Married with 4 kids. I was previously in the veterinary field but have been a stay at home mom for the past 8 years.
I like cars and i built my first pc this year that I use for gaming.
I just started keeping jumping spiders as pets, their names are Rui, Inko, Pumpkin,Tiny and Venom.
I also have terrible anxiety. Please excuse my lack of articulation I have had no real social life and my closest friends are toddlers.
